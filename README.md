# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository contains C implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms, including:

- 🔁 Bubble Sort  
- 🧩 Insertion Sort  
- 📥 Selection Sort  
- 🔄 Substitution Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in a clean and understandable way, intended for educational purposes and for those who want to better understand the mechanics of sorting at a low level.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── src
│ ├── bubleSort.c          # Bubble Sort implementation
│ ├── insertionSort.c      # Insertion Sort implementation
│ ├── selectionSort.c      # Selection Sort implementation
│ ├── substitutionSort.c   # Substitution Sort implementation

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

You’ll need a C compiler like `gcc`.

### 🔧 Build & Run

To compile and run the program, add your custom `main.c` file and follow this instruction :

```bash
gcc main.c -o sort
./sort
````

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

* **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing with the left side.
* **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest element and moves it to the sorted part.
* **Substitution Sort**: *(Custom or lesser-known algorithm — clarify implementation details here if applicable).*

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project is designed to:

* Help students understand core sorting algorithms.
* Provide a playground to test and visualize sorting behavior.
* Encourage algorithm comparison and performance analysis.
